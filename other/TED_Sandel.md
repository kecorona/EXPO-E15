The marketization of everything sharpens the sting of inequality and its social and civic consequence

### Reason 2

#### With some social goods and practices, when market thinking and market values enter, they may change the meaning of those practices and crowd out attitudes and norms worth caring about.

Example Of a controversial use of a market mechanism–a cash incentive

Many schools struggle with the challenge of motivating kids, especially with kids from disadvantaged backgrounds, to study hard, to do well in school, to apply themselves.
	Some economics have proposed a market solution–offer cash incentives to kids for getting good grades or high test scores

	Experiment results:
		Higher grades: no
		# books read: more, but shorter books

		What will become of these kids later
		Will they learn that reading is a chore, a form of peace work to be done for pay
		Done initially for the wrong reason but fall in love with reading for its own sake

	Economists often assume the markets are inert, that they do not touch or taint the goods they exchange
		Market exchange, they assume, does not change the meaning or value of the goods being exchanged
			May be true for material goods
			May not be true for non-material goods and social practices (teaching or learning, engaging together in civic life)
				In those domains, bringing market mechanisms and cash incentives may undermine or crowd out non-market values and attitudes worth caring about

Once we see that markets and commerce, when extended beyond the material domain, can change the character of the goods themselves–can change the meaning of the social practices, as in the example of teaching and learning

We have to ask where markets belong and where they don't, where they may actually undermine values and attitudes worth caring about

We have to reason together in public about the value and meaning of the social practices we prize
	From our bodies, to family life, to personal relations, to health, to teaching and learning, to civic life

	Controvercial questions, so we tend to shrink from them

	During the past three decades, when market reasoning and market thinking have gathered force and gained prestige, our public discourse during this time has become hollowed out, empty of larger moral meaning.

	For fear of disagreement, we shrink from these questions, but once we see that markets change the character of goods, we have to debate amongst ourselves these bigger questions about how to value goods.

	One of the most corrosive effects of how to value everything is commonality against the background of rising inequality.

	Marketizing every aspect of life leads to a condition where those who are affluent, those who are of modest means, increasing live different lives.

		We live, work, shop, and play at different places. Our children go to different schools

	This isn't good for democracy, nor is it a satisfying way to live–even for those of us who can afford to buy their way to the head of the line.

Democracy does not require perfect equality. What it does require is that citizens share in a common life. What matters is that people of different backgrounds encounter one another in the ordinary course of life.

	Teaches us to negotiate and to abide our differences, and this is how we come to care for the common good.

	The question of markets is not mainly an economic question, it's really a question of how we want to live together.

	Do we want a society where everything is up for sale? Or are there certain moral and civic goods the markets do not honor and money cannot buy.
