# Class 10 Notes

## How is Unit 2 different?

* Working with longer texts, more complicated ideas, and more complex arguments

* Responding to central text _in terms of_ and _in coordination with_ other responses

* In other words, using and integrating other voices (a.k.a., sources) into your argument

* (Also, response papers do not have drafts!)

## Why Use Sources?

* To enter into a conversation about important subjects rather than "present decrees" on them

* To "credential" ourselves as belonging in the conversation
	* Prove that we belong in the conversation–show that we have a "right to know"

>WANDLER RANT

>Wandler project: Theories of knowledge in the digital era

>Idea of scholarship is not democratic, you do not get a seat at a table just because you are a citizen, you need to earn that right by credentialing yourself

>How? ... good question

>Mimicking intellectual moves we need to do in order to credential ourselves

>This is what happens when you go through a concentration at harvard

>What you're doing is proving that you belong in the conversation because you got this degree at this standard

>END WANDLER RANT

* To compare and contrast ideas in order to improve overall understanding

* And move us toward as much of a consensus as possible

* Sources don't replace your own argument; they augment and enhance it

* You don't present the source's argument – you use it to advance and present your own

## What Can Sources Do?

* They can provide factual information
	* Background, data, statistics, biographical, information, dates, etc.

* They can provide arguments/ideas/claims
	- that you engage, challenge, build on, etc.

* In other words, please note that sources don't just prove arguments right or wrong... they just present what others argue or know

## The Danger of Sources

* The danger of losing your voice
	* That is, the danger of _describing_ the conversation rather than _participating in_ it

* The danger of mismanaging voices
	* That is, the danger of letting sources of one kind act like sources of another kind
	* For exampe, using facts as arguments or vice versa
		* i.e., climate change argument

* The danger of subordinating yourself to sources
	* That is, the danger of simply mimicking or presengint another voice as "right"
	* Creating the sense of safistication and scholarship
		* Moves you up into nuanced understanding of knowledge and understanding and how they interact to make new and better arguments

# Michael Sandel
*Teaches famous cource on Justice
* Wrote his dissertation (later published as _Liberalism and the Limits of Justice_) on John Rawls' _Theory of Justice_ **READ**
* Often associated with "communitarianism"
* Confirmed to be the inspirations for Mr. Burns in _The Simpsons_
	* The finger gesture
	**WOAH**

## NOT the "real question"

* NOT a question of potential medical dangers
	* He begins by stating that he is writing about genetic enhancement
	* 'Even though everyone is already against genetic enhancement, they are against it, but they don't know why they should be (misinformed, incorrect reasons)
	* Sandel states all of the arguments, and why they are wrong
		* Not a question of the potential medical dangers

	* Imagine if it were made perfectly safe

* NOT a question of "fairness"
	* Things are already deeply "unfair" on the genetic level
	* Unnatural unfairness is no different from _natural_ unfairness
	* Why does it matter if someone is better than you at somethign because of natural or artificial reasons?

* NOT a question of "access" or "creating two races"
	* Could potentially be answered through government subsidy, takes, etc.
	* Disguises the real worry: is it bad to be left behind _un_enhanced, or is it bad to enhance?
	* Do we regret those who choose to perfect their children, or do we regret those who are unable to?
		* Sandel is saying that is kind of the former

* NOT a question of "genetic arms race"
	* A question of motive and intention, not consequence
	* Takes and other procedures could offset costs
	* Do we "want to live in a society where parents feel compelled to spend a fortune to make perfectly healthy kids a few inches taller?"

* NOT a question of "autonomy"
