# Class 10 Notes

## How is Unit 2 different?

* Working with longer texts, more complicated ideas, and more complex arguments
* Responding to central text _in terms of_ and _in coordination with_ other responses
* In other words, using and integrating other voices (a.k.a., sources) into your argument
* (Also, response papers do not have drafts!)

## Why Use Sources?

* To enter into a conversation about important subjects rather than "present decrees" on them
* To "credential" ourselves as belonging in the conversation
	* Prove that we belong in the conversation–show that we have a "right to know"

			Idea of scholarship is not democratic, you do not get a seat at a table just because you are a citizen, you need to earn that right by credentialing yourself
			How? ... good question
				Mimicking intellectual moves we need to do in order to credential ourselves
				This is what happens when you go through a concentration at harvard
				What you're doing is proving that you belong in the conversation because you got this degree at this standard

* To compare and contrast ideas in order to improve overall understanding
	* And move us toward as much of a consensus as possible
* Sources don't replace your own argument; they augment and enhance it
	* You don't present the source's argument – you use it to advance and present your own
