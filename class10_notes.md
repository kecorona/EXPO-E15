# Class 10 Notes

## How is Unit 2 different?

* Working with longer texts, more complicated ideas, and more complex arguments

* Responding to central text _in terms of_ and _in coordination with_ other responses

* In other words, using and integrating other voices (a.k.a., sources) into your argument

* (Also, response papers do not have drafts!)

## Why Use Sources?

* To enter into a conversation about important subjects rather than "present decrees" on them

* To "credential" ourselves as belonging in the conversation
	* Prove that we belong in the conversation–show that we have a "right to know"

>Idea of scholarship is not democratic, you do not get a seat at a table just because you are a citizen, you need to earn that right by credentialing yourself

>How? ... good question

>Mimicking intellectual moves we need to do in order to credential ourselves

>This is what happens when you go through a concentration at harvard

>What you're doing is proving that you belong in the conversation because you got this degree at this standard

>END WANDLER RANT

* To compare and contrast ideas in order to improve overall understanding

* And move us toward as much of a consensus as possible

* Sources don't replace your own argument; they augment and enhance it

* You don't present the source's argument – you use it to advance and present your own

## What Can Sources Do?

* They can provide factual information
	* Background, data, statistics, biographical, information, dates, etc.

* They can provide arguments/ideas/claims
	- that you engage, challenge, build on, etc.

* In other words, please note that sources don't just prove arguments right or wrong... they just present what others argue or know

## The Danger of Sources

* The danger of losing your voice
	* That is, the danger of _describing_ the conversation rather than _participating in_ it

* The danger of mismanaging voices
	* That is, the danger of letting sources of one kind act like sources of another kind
	* For exampe, using facts as arguments or vice versa
		* i.e., climate change argument

* The danger of subordinating yourself to sources
	* That is, the danger of simply mimicking or presengint another voice as "right"
	* Creating the sense of safistication and scholarship
		* Moves you up into nuanced understanding of knowledge and understanding and how they interact to make new and better arguments
