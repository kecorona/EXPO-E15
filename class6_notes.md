Academic Writing
-----------------

### What is academic writing?

* How is it different from other types of writing, like journalism, fiction, memoir, biography, etc.?
  * Analysis

* What are its most prominent characteristics?
* What does it look like? 
* What is its tone like?
* What is its style like? What is its purpose?


### The Four Tenets of Academic Writing
#### 1. Academic writing ALWAYS begins by asking real questions

  1. Real questions are questions for which we don't have real answers

  2. [CRUCIAL HINT #1] Real questions almost always come from the texts or material that you are analyzing, NOT from your own opinions on or interests in an issue

  3. Real questions are questions ALL readers should have
  Real questions are questions that require an argument to be answered

#### 2. Academic writing makes real arguments

##### What is a 'real' argument?

  
  1. A real argument is rooted in analysis, evidence, and logical development

  2. A real argument responds to and engages positions and views that reasonable people actually hold (i.e., no "straw man" arguments)

  3. An argument is 'real' only if reasonable, intelligent people think it might be wrong

  [CRUCIAL HINT #2] Any thesis statement that you produce for this class must have a logical, reasonable, and possible 
 'counter' thesis statement
 You should be able to write an opposite thesis statement that still makes sense and seems reasonable, and seems like an arguemtn people actually might make. If you can't do this, you don't have a good thesis statement.

 #### 3. Academic essays are structured according to the logic of the argument, NOT a formula

 [CRUCIAL HINT #3]
 A good way to test the structure of your essay is to ask whether you can rearrange the order of the paragraphs without affecting the argument.

 #### 4. In academic writing, sources are used to make a new argument.

 Academic Questions
