##	Hemel / Lincoln
Daniel Hemel’s <a href="https://github.com/kecorona/EXPO-E15/tree/master/resources">_A New Birth of Freedom_: The Evolution of Lincoln’s Views on Race”</a>
### Introduction
 * From Expose
 * Winner of the Sosland Prize
 * Reviewed by faculty from variety of fields and disciplines

###	Why Hemel's 'question' is a good one
* Uses pivot words like "however", "but", "while" to illustrate tension
* (note the initial "however", which occurs in the logical as well as spatial center of the paragraph)
suppresses his own "voice" - uses quotes and texts to raise the question

###	The kinds of questions we ask
* there is an ambiguity that is worth clearing up
* there is a contradiction or tensino worth resolving or investigating
* there is a mystery or puzzle worth resolving or investigating
* there are questions raised with unclear answers
* what seems simple is more complicated than it seems
* what seems insignificant yields something important upon deeper investigation

###	Questioning Deresiewicz

> "The first disadvantage of an elite education [...] is that it makes you
> incapable of talking to people who aren't like you"(1).

> "So alien was [the plumber's] experience to me, so unguessable his 
> values...."

> The experience of "entitled mediocrity" is very different from that of a 
> "friend of mine who went to Cleveland State" (3).

> "My friend once got a D in a class in which she'd been running an A 
> because she was coming off a waitressing shift..."(3).

* Deresiewicz claims "Ivy retardation" as the source of his inability to talk to a plumber
* Which stems, more largelu from the sense of superiority incalculated in elites
* Yet he has a close friend (with many details from her life) who goes to a state school and is a waitress

Plumbers vs waitresses
* He is and isn't able to talk to those unlike him
* He does and doesn't look down on non-elites
* What counts as the 'first' disadvantage of the elite education comes and goes with different examples!

####	How would we 'show' this question?
* Next: show WD's first example
- Give context for plumber
- Discuss "Ivy retardation"

* Next: _however_ moment and WD's 2nd example
- 'However' ... WD

* Next: present the 'question'
- WD contradicts himself
- Or WD's sense of the importance of the 'first' disadvantage ebbs and flows with particular example or piece of evidence

####	So What?
* Why is this question important
* Why should we care if (for example) WD contradicts himself or is ambiguous?
* What are the larger implicatinos for his overall argument if he contradicts himself or is ambigious on this point?
* Why is asking this question, and thinking about its "answer", valuable or worthwhile


##	Thinking about Thesis Statements

###	Definitions
-- Thesis = an essay's _overall argument_ – the thesis is present in every section and paragraph of the essay
-- Thesis statement = the _one sentence_ crystallization of that overall argument; it appears only once, which is _almost always the last sentence of the first paragraph_.

##	Bad Thesis Statements
1.	Deresiewicz claims that there are many disadvantages to an elite education, but my friend went to Yale and he's a great guy!
