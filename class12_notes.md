### Developing Essay 2
* Three questions to answer:
	1. What will your overall argument look like?
		* Your argument must answer three questions:
			1. What do you think about Sandel's argument about genetic enhancement and engineering.
			2. Why do you think what you think about it?
			3. What is important about what you think about it (in other words, 'so what?' of what you think about it?)
		* You are not just answering these questions in terms of your own analysis – you are also incorporating the ideas, claims, critiques, and so on of the three critical articles
		* In that sene, your argument itself will be modified or even determined by __what you think about the critical articles__
		* In other words, your argument will be a kind of 'adjudication' among the different texts in terms of who is right or wrong and __why__
	2. What role will the critical articles play?
	3. What will the structure look like?
