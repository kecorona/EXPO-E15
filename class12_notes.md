# Developing Essay 2
## Three questions to answer:
	### 1. What will your overall argument look like?
		* Your argument must answer three questions:
			1. What do you think about Sandel's argument about genetic enhancement and engineering.
			2. Why do you think what you think about it?
			3. What is important about what you think about it (in other words, 'so what?' of what you think about it?)
		* You are not just answering these questions in terms of your own analysis – you are also incorporating the ideas, claims, critiques, and so on of the three critical articles
		* In that sene, your argument itself will be modified or even determined by __what you think about the critical articles__
		* In other words, your argument will be a kind of 'adjudication' among the different texts in terms of who is right or wrong and __why__
		* The point here is to 'contribute' to the ongoing conversation
			* What counts as a 'contribution'?
				* Ways to make a contribution
					* Qualifying the data or a claim made in the conversation
					* Expanding on a claim
					* Introducing a new component into claim
					* Invalidating one position (in a new way, for new reasons)
					* Exposing 'hidden' assumptions in the conversation					
				* The point is that the conversation will in some way be altered by your essay
					- Note how they are all _about the conversation_
				* So, __you should be able to articulate the way that you are altering the conversation!__
					- Indeed, this is actually your thesis statement
				* NB: This essay has artificial constraints we should recognize
		
		#### Bad Thesis Statements
			1. As, Fox, Levitt, and Elliott all show, there are a variety of ways to think about Sandel's argument in __The Case against Perfection__.
				* Problem:
					* Summarizes the conversation without contributing to the conversation

			2. Even though Sandel argues that freedom and autonomy are not an issue in the debate over genetic enhancement and engineering, Levitt correctly argues that issues of personal liberty are paramount.
				* Problem:
					* Disjunctive syllogism

			3. Fox, Levitt, and Elliott all point out that Sandel's argument against genetic enhancement leaves many important moral issues unresolved and ambigious; however, the real problem with Sandel'a argument is that it is overly religious.
				* Problem:
					* Describes what the author things without connecting or identifying with the conversation at hand
						* What you think must be informed by and a part of the conversation
					* There is no evidence qualified by the predicate. This is two thoughts  rather than about one idea. This might be too much opinion about facts.

	### 2. What role will the critical articles play?
		#### The Proper Rols of the Critical Articles
			* As these bad thesis statements demonstrate, your Essay 2 shouldn't be a 'book report', nor should it be a 'cheering section,' nor should it be your own argument with the critical articles simply 'in tow'
			* Instead, the critical articles should play a role in determining what your argument is
			* In order to do so, you first need to __clearly articulate__ your stances toward the critical articles

			* Your stances can be:
				- Yes(agree), and so...
				- No(disagree), and so...
				- Sort of, and so...
			* Before you begin writing Essay 2, be sure to write our whom you agree with, when, where, and why

		#### Bringing in Other Voices
			* Why do we do it?
				* To help argue a point being made
					- the other voice porvides an important or prominent articulation
				* To argue against or build on an argument
					- For example, to show that a prominent idea or view is wrong, or should be corrected, or has problems, inconsistencies, and so on
					- Or to show that parts, but not all, of the arguments are valid, but the others should be enhanced, deepened, rejected, etc.
	### 3. What will the structure look like?
		#### What to tell the reader
			* What Sandel argues in "Case"
			* What you think about what Sandel argues
			* What the critics say about Sandel's argument
			* What you think about what the critics say
		#### How to structure
			* An introduction (of the article, the main ideas at play, your thesis statement, etc.)
			* Summaries (of Sandel's main ideas and points, of the articles' main ideas and points)
			* Analyses (of Sandel AND the critical articles)
			* A conclusion (about what the conversation leads to, how we properly think about the "Case,"), etc.
		#### Sample Structure 1
			1. Into (problem, thesis statement, etc.)
			2. Summary of Sandel's argument
			3. Your initial analysis of Sandel's argument
			4. A section that summarizes Elliott's argument (1 paragraph), a discussion of why you agree with him, and what it helps you say about Sandel(1 paragraph)
			5. A 'however' paragraph on Levitt's argument
			6. A 'however' analysis of Levitt's argument
			7. A conclusion paragraph that draws your final conclusions about Sandel's argument
		#### Sample Structure 2
			1. Intro (problem, thesis statement, etc.)
			2. Summary of Sandel's argument
			3. Summary of Levitt's argument
			4. An analysis of Levitt's argument that incorporates your own analysis of Sandel (2 paragraphs)
			5. A summary and analysis of Ellitt's argument that leads to...
			6. A conclusion paragraph that draws your final conclusions about Sandel's argument
