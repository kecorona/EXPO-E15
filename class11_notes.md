* Your assignment

## Sandel's 'Case'

### Excellence

* "[S]triving is not the point of sports; excellence is. Ance excellence consists at least partly in the display of natural talents and gifts that are no doing of the athlete who possesses them"

* Pete Rose vs. Joe Dimaggio
	Striving is not the point of sports
	The excellence that results from that sriving is the poit of sports

* Imagine awarding runs / score based on effort rather than accomplishment

### Embarrassing the "meriocratic faith"

* The faith that we get what we deserve, through earning, striving, hard work, etc.
	* What we have is what we deserve; rewards goes to those who work hard
* The difference between earning and inheriting

* But: Michael Jordan's contract
	* It's not about who's trying harder, it's about who wins the games

* But: your grades on papers

### Why is healing ok?

* Healing does not ovverride natural capacities but allows them to flourish
* Good health is a condition for a good life, not the object or goal of a good life (we don't aspire to be a "virtuoso at health")
* More and more health does not increase our success (i.e.m health is not a 'tool')

### Unconditional Love

* An openness to the unbidden
* Accept children as gifts, not products of our will or instruments of our ambition:
	-"Parental loe is not contingent on the talents and attrivutes the child happen to have"
* But there is still "accepting and transforming love"
* Hyperparenting: "this demand for performance and perfection [...] is the deepest source of the moral trouble with enhancement"

### Effect #1

#### Diminishing humility

* G.E. would make the "myth of the self-made man" come true
* Our talents become our achievement, not a gift for which we should be humbly grateful

### Effect #2

####Explosion of responsibility

* "The more we become masters of our genetic endowments, the greater the burden we bear for the talents we have and the way we perform"
	We become responsibile for our achievements and lack of achievements
* Athletes failing, students performing poorly, babies being handicapped, etc.

### Effect #3

#### Erosion of solidarity

* Insurance markets
* "Mutuality by inadvertence"
* The successful are lucky and so have an obligation to share with the simply unlucky
* "the deserving rich," "the deserving poor"

## What can we do with Sources?

* We must always _establish a 'stance'_ toward our sources
	A stance is the position (or attitude) you as a writer take toward a source
	A stance must be present for every source use
	A stance is how you avoid merely 'echoing' sources and establish your own argument

### What stances can we take toward sources?
* YES (I agree with or approve of this source), AND SO (this agreement contributes to my argument in this way)
* NO (I disagree or disapprove of this source), AND SO (this disagreement contributes to my own argument in this way)
* YES BUT (this source is sort of right but needs correction)

* So you should always be able to look at any source in your essay and see whether it is...
	Yes, and so...
	No, and so...
	Sort of, and so...
* If you can't say one of these three things, you are in danger of merely mimicking or echoing your sources. Don't do this!

# Dov Fox, "Self-Made Men and Man-Made Selves"
* Generally approving of Sandel's argument:
	His "empirical spculation" is commended – until

* However, "Sandel does not tell us whether the moral bads of parental controllingness and civic egoism ultimately outweigh the moral goods of parental liberty in reproductive decision-making and the promise of producing future generations who are more likely to have their lives go well" (667)
	* In other words, the larger point or concern is that we are now confronted with a conflict of two worthy values
	* What do we do when neither choice is right?

# Elliot, "The Mixed Promise of Genetic Medicine"
* The transformation of cosmetic surgery from a harmful practice to "psychiatry with a scalpel" (2024.1)
* In other words, we can treat one kind of problem (psychological) with another method (medicine, surgery)

# Your Assignment
* Start thinking about your stances toward these sources: Whose argument do you find convincing (including Sandel's own) and why?
* Complete Response Paper 6 (comparing the critical articles)
* I will retain BEST FIVE RP scores for final grade (if you're happy with your five current scores, no need to do RP6)
