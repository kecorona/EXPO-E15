## Explicating Quotes

## Transition Sentences: 

### Echoing

### Paraphrase and preview

Think of your transition as a bridge.

"__Although Deresiewicz argues that elite education makes one incapable of communicating with anyone unlike one's self,__ he fails to recognize that this same problem applies to all levels and types of education, not just the elite."


### Return to the Thesis

__Because__ Deresiewicz's examples of the inability to communicate are both arbitrary and contradictory, __a fundamental flaw in this crucial aspect of his argument about the disadvantages of elite education develops.__

### Paragraphs

The point of a paragraph...

Paragraphs sould be organized around their _purpose_ (not 'just' their content)

	What is the paragraph about?
	What is the paragraph _doing_? (is it summary, etc)
	Why is the paragraph doing this? What does it accomplish in the overall arc of the argument("why am I summarizing here")

Paragraphs should always be checked for
	Transition and connection between sentences within paragraph
	Voices: who is speaking, when, where, and why (is 'your' voice there?)
	Where does your paragraph start
	Where does the paragraph end
	How long is it? (rules of thumb)

Revision strategy:
	For each of your paragraphs, write out the following:
		The content of the paragraph (what it will be about)
		The purpose of the paragraph (what role it plays in your developing argument)
		The paragraph's connection to the previous paragraphs

## Conclusions

What a conclusion isn't
	Something that comes after the end of your argument
	A chance to 'rehearse' or 'summarize' your argument

Conclusion Suggestions:
	Return to your opening question
	Analyze an especially important quote
